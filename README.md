# Ecosystems_stream-metabolism-2021
This contains data and code for my paper on stream metabolism responses to a watershed scale addition of cover crops in a an Indiana agricultural stream (doi: TBD).

Figure 1. The maps were made in ArcGis with some help from Powerpoint (Figures 1 and 2.ppxt). GIS files available if you are interested (too big for Github).

Figure 2 was made by hand in Powerpoint. The lines were drawn through the monthly medians of data in SDW (Figures 1 and 2.ppxt). 

"full metabolism.csv"-contains stream metabolism estimates from streamMetabolizer, daily total precipitation, daily average turbidity, and daily averaged modeled light (modeled light from streamMetabolizer). The raw data for stream metabolism estimates as well as the model itself are available at data.streampulse.org (Region=IN, site=SDW). These data were used to make Figures 3, 4, and 5 ("Figures 4 5 and 6.R"). Regretably, Figure 2 was initially made in Sigmaplot, but it uses the same data. 

"HR_AR_metabolism.csv"-contains the estimates of heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration estimated using Hall and Beaulieu 2013 (doi:10.1899/12-147.1). These data were used to make Figure 6 ("Figures 4 5 and 6.R").

"SDW storm.csv"-contains data from the 16 storms for making figure 7 (Figure 7.R)
